# Domestic Politics, Contentious
Issue Claims, and Economic
Interdependence

R code and data for Chapter 4 of my dissertation: George W. Williford. 2021. "Domestic Politics, Contentious
Issue Claims, and Economic
Interdependence."

## Project Description

Does economic interdependence influence how states manage claims over contentious issues? A vast literature explores whether interdependence is associated with a decrease in militarized conflict. However, existing research does not pay much attention to whether interdependence facilitates the peaceful management of claims. I argue that the existence of claims themselves create economic opportunity costs for disputants. This provides domestic groups with an interest in bilateral trade with an incentive to pressure leaders to resolve the issues that states compete over peacefully. I find some evidence that states resolve claims over contentious issues more quickly when the actors involved are dependent on each other for their economic well-being.

## Methods Used

- Cure models
- Survival Analysis

## Software Used

Analysis was conducted in R, version 4.01. The analysis was completed using my R package for estimating proportional hazards cure models with time-varying covariates. The package, tvcure, can be found [here](https://github.com/gwilliford/Proportional-Hazards-Cure-Models).
