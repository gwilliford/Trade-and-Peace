Japan and China - long

So Russia didn’t adopt a militarized response in this case. It used its position as a colonial power to force a disintegrating Qing dynasty to the table. And I'm not sure what “ethnic connection” means here—yes, for the Manchu Qing dynasty, Manchuria had special import, but if the authors are attempting to say that this connection meant that it was unlikely to accept territorial bargains then, no, this is not the case. And in the case of Japan, that state did adopt a highly militarized response after 1931.


Japan and Russia - short, but no military response

don’t make the causal case that it is the target’s intangible salience that leads the challengers to adopt more militarized strategies.

Variables such as the number of fatal MIDS, the frequency and duration of the dispute, don’t actually get at what the author’s want (and need) to explain: the challenger’s choice of strategy.

So when the authors say that territory might be more divisible for one side than the other, what they really mean is that the territory might be more intangibly salient for one side than another—if one side sees the territory as divisible, then it should be divisible through some mechanism.

To build out the logic of the theory, I think a 2x2 might be helpful, one that deductively walks through what happens in four worlds: the challenger sees the territory has having high salience, the target low; the target seeing high salience, the challenger low; both low; and both high (this last one should be “indivisible”). This would allow the reader to see the strategic interaction within the dyads.
