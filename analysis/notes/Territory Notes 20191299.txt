There is a large body of literature exploring the management of territorial disputes. 

Territorial disputes are more likely to lead to militarized conflict and war than disputes over any other issue (Hensel 1996; Hensel et al. 2008; Vasquez 2009; Vasquez and Henehan 2001). Despite this, how states choose to manage territorial disputes varies considerably across claims. The course and outcome of territorial disputes varies widely, including whether states choose to pursue militarized or peaceful settlement techniques and the intensity with which they pursue these options.

Previous research demonstrates that this variation is explained in large part by the attributes of a particular piece of territory. 

States are generally willing to pay higher costs to acquire or defend territory that is highly salient (Hensel 2001; Huth 2009). v







Land may be considered valuable for any number of reasons, including its natural resource endowments, strategic location, and symbolic value to leaders or their domestic audiences. 








States value characteristics for a number of attributes








The more of these characteristics that a piece of territory holds, the more important it is to state leaders and their domestic audiences. 





Because salience determines the costs that states are willing to bear to obtain or maintain control over a piece of territory, it plays a large role in determining what types of claim management strategies states pursue.




----- CONFLICT TO PEACEFUL ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----- STATES ASCRIBE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF VALUE ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of course, not all territory is equally valuable. The value or salience that states ascribe to territorial claims depends on the attributes or stakes that a piece of territory possesses. 
The salience of an issue is determined by the extent to which the domestic population of a state and its leaders care about an issue (Diehl 1992). As a result, each state may assign different levels of value to each territory. For example, one state may value a piece of territory purely for the natural resources it contains, while another state may regard the same piece of land as a part of its ethnic homeland.



----- SALIENCE INFLUENCES CLAIM MANAGEMENT -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since territorial salience influences the costs that states are willing to bear to settle a dispute, salience of a piece of territory influences the claim management strategies that states select. 

Since states will bear higher costs to obtain or defend highly salient territory, making them more prone to engage in militarized behavior to force their opponents to settle claims (Hensel 2001; Hensel et al. 2008). 



Salience may also play a role in helping states determine which peaceful conflict management strategies they use to attempt to resolve a claim (Allee and Huth 2006; Hensel 2001; Simmons 2002). % Hassner (2007) argues that territorial disputes become more harder to resolve over time as states ascribe higher material and symbolic value to territory the longer a dispute drags on.


States are also more willing to engage in peaceful settlement attempts over highly salient claims (Hensel 2001; Hensel et al. 2008), although these attempts are less likely to result in an agreement and states are less likely to comply with agreements signed over highly salient issues (Mitchell and Hensel 2007). 




----- TANGIBLE VS INTANGIBLE --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition, the extent to which states value a claim for its tangible and intangible attributes influences the conflict management strategies chosen (Diehl 1992; Hensel and Mitchell 2005; Mansbach and Vasquez 1981). Tangible attributes are those tied to the physical characteristics of the territory itself, including natural resources, population, and strategic or economic value. States may also imbue territory with intangible, constructed value. For example, a piece of land may hold religious significance, ethnic or national identity, or ideological value (Diehl 1992; Hensel 2001; Mansbach and Vasquez 1981; Vasquez 2009). 

Disputes over intangible goods are generally more difficult to resolve than those over tangible goods. This stems from the fact that intangible goods are often indivisible, while tangible goods are often perfectly divisible. For example, while a state that values a piece of territory for its natural resources may be satisfied with obtaining only part of that valuable land, a state that claims a piece of territory as its homeland is unlikely to be satisfied with controlling only part of that land. As a result, disputes over indivisible issues often take on a winner-take-all nature. Such claims can only be resolved if one state relinquishes their claim (either unilaterally or as a result of a negotiated settlement) or if one state asserts control over the territory by force. Claims over intangible issues are thus more likely to lead to the outbreak of war and are less likely to result in border settlement (Toft 2003). Claims involving highly salient intangible issues can thus be particularly difficult to resolve since finding sufficiently valuable side payments is difficult. This makes fatal militarized disputes and war more likely (Hensel and Mitchell 2005; Toft 2003). 

Because of the bargaining difficulties posed by indivisible intangible issues, leaders can use these issues to strategic effect. By adding highly salient intangible issues to those under dispute a leader can tie their hands in the hopes that it will increase their costs of conceding and thereby forcing the other state to provide them with a more satisfactory outcome. This strategy leads to long lasting disputes because the additional highly salient intangible issues makes it more difficult for the actors to resolve their dispute. However, as noted above, the incorporation of indivisible issues may also make it more difficult for states to identify mutually acceptable bargains. As a result, incorporating indivisible issues into a claim can lead to longer and more conflict prone territorial disputes (Goddard 2006, 2010). In addition, states may try to tie [claims over territory with high intangible salience] to unrelated issues in order to increase their bargaining leverage in disputes over unrelated issues (Wiegand 2011). % TODO - [Expand]

Although previous research provides valuable insights into the territorial dispute process, existing research glosses over important differences in the salience of a piece of territory to the disputants, in two important ways. First, most existing research does not consider the variation in salience between two disputants and considers salience as a unidimensional dyadic variable. Although each state may assign different levels of value to the same piece of territory, most empirical research combines state-level measures of salience to create an aggregate dyadic salience index. However, the strategic position of each state involved in a territorial claim differs depending on whether they are the challenger (i.e., the state that desires part of another state’s territory) or the target. Each state’s status as the challenger or target determines, in part, their position in the dispute and their options for pursuing a resolution to that dispute. As such, the way that the salience and divisibility of the issues involved influences a claimant’s strategy is also contingent upon their strategic position as the target or challenger.

Second, most research on issue salience does not distinguish between the effects of tangible and intangible salience on the bargaining process.\footnote{One exception is Hensel and Mitchell (2005).} Since bargaining over intangible issues tends to be more difficult, we contend that intangible salience will be a more important determinant of how states manage a particular conflict than intangible salience. Ultimately, whether the disputed territory possesses intangible values that are sought by the target, the challenger, or both disputants will have important effects on the strategic incentives for the competitors. We contend that scholars must consider separately the relative level of intangible salience that each state assigns to a piece of territory. This will lead to wide and unexplored variation in the duration of the territorial dispute and the level of military violence associated with the competition over the territory.
