# Introduction

Conceptually, actors bargaining over territory can resolve claims in one of three ways. First, one state may choose to seize the contested territory or coerce the other disputant to relinquish possession of the territory by force. Second, the states can come to some negotiated decision regarding a mutually acceptable division of the territory through the use of peaceful conflict management mechanisms. Notably, such an agreement may end up codifying the status quo. Third, one state may choose to drop their claim by relinquishing it. This may be done either officially, wherein a representative of the state renounces the claim, or unofficially, wherein state policymakers quit pursuing a claim and it comes to a de facto end.

Theory

- Claims create opp costs
- Since claims themselves create potential opportunity costs, those engaged in bilateral trade have an incentive to do more than simply oppose military conflict. They also have an incentive to bring an end to the claim itself to secure their existing trading relationships and potentially expand them as the barriers that claims create fall away.

# Domestic Politics and Territory



# Domestic Politics and Claim Resolution

Which option states choose to pursue depends on a mix of domestic and international factors. The linkages between domestic politics and the management of territorial claims can be seen by conceptualizing territorial claims as two-level games \citep{putnam1988}. Claims themselves constitute a bargaining problem at the international level, wherein both states compete to obtain some distribution of a contested piece of territory. A state and its government may have an inherent interest in controlling territory for reasons related to foreign policy, such as security concerns or establishing a sphere of influence in an area. In order for a claim to be resolved, states must identify a distribution of the territory that both prefer to leaving the claim unresolved. When states can identify an agreement that is acceptable to both, the two have an incentive to settle and end the costs associated with the ongoing claim.

The state has inherent interests in the outcome of territorial claims, such as security, sovereignty, status, and establishing a sphere of influence. 

Whether two states can identify a mutually acceptable bargain depends on the preferences of influential domestic actors within both states. Because leaders are beholden to societal actors at the domestic level who have interests in the international environment, leaders must also consider domestic political constraints when negotiating at the international level. All leaders, regardless of regime type, depend on societal actors who have the power to sustain or remove them from power \citep{bdm2003}, a group known as the winning coalition. In order to retain office, leaders must pursue policies that maximize the returns these groups receive. Thus, if leaders agree to bargains that the winning coalition find unacceptable, leaders risk being replaced. 

**Ratification**

The preferences of leaders are also constrained insofar as domestic actors have the power to implicitly or explicitly ratify agreements. 

With respect to ratification, the successful implementation of any agreement requires the cooperation of at least some domestic actors who have the power to stymie its entry into force.\footnote{Following \citet{putnam1988}, I use the term ``ratification’’ to refer broadly to any process at the domestic level that is necessary to implement international agreements. This includes formal processes required for a treaty to enter into force, such as approval by a legislature, or informal processes by which other powerful veto players (e.g., the military, bureaucracies, or administration officials) must approve of an agreement in order for it to be implemented effectively.} 

The implementation of an agreement is thus contingent on whether the leader can obtain the support of relevant domestic actors by convincing them that the outcome of an agreement is preferable to the status quo. The number, size, and constitution of these actors varies widely depending on domestic institutions and the content of an agreement. Some treaties may be subject to the direct approval of voters in the form of referenda or plebiscites and must therefore be broadly popular with the public as a whole in order to be implemented. In other cases, ratification depends on the support of elected officials, who in turn are beholden to the preferences of constituents and/or subject to lobbying by influential groups. In order to obtain domestic support for ratification, leaders must thus be able to piece together coalitions of influential actors that support the agreement \citep{fearon1998}.

Leaders who sign agreements that are unpopular among their domestic supporters will be unable to obtain their support in the process of ratifying an agreement and adhering to it over the long term. 

As such, reaching an agreement requires that international negotiators identify a distribution of the territory that is not only acceptable to both states for foreign policy reasons but is also acceptable to the winning coalition of both states.
