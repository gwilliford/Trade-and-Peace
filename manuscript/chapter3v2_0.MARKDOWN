# Introduction

## Conceptualization of Claim Resolution

Conceptually, actors bargaining over territory can resolve claims in one of three ways. First, one state may choose to seize the contested territory or coerce the other disputant to relinquish possession of the territory by force. Second, the states can come to some negotiated decision regarding a mutually acceptable division of the territory through the use of peaceful conflict management mechanisms. Notably, such an agreement may end up codifying the status quo. Third, one state may choose to drop their claim by relinquishing it. This may be done either officially, wherein a representative of the state renounces the claim, or unofficially, wherein state policymakers quit pursuing a claim and it comes to a de facto end.

# Lit Review

- Interdependence and Conflict (general)
  - Opp costs
  - Signaling
- Opp costs mechanism
  - The most common explanation for the relationship between interdependence and conflict, and the focus of this article, is based on the opportunity costs associated with fighting.
  - Trade creates opportunity costs
  - Prospective Opportunity Costs
- Domestic Groups and Opportunity Costs
- Homogeneity of Preferences

Domestic Politics and Claim Resolution

- Domestic win-sets are important
- Contentious issue claims and domestic politics 
- Barriers to claim resolution

Theory

- Claims create opp costs
- Since claims themselves create potential opportunity costs, those engaged in bilateral trade have an incentive to do more than simply oppose military conflict. They also have an incentive to bring an end to the claim itself to secure their existing trading relationships and potentially expand them as the barriers that claims create fall away. 

# Domestic Politics and Territory

While settling territorial claims may be unpopular in some cases, the potential economic benefits of settlement may provide elites with incentives to pressure their leaders to settle claims in spite of those drawbacks. 

An example of this dynamic involves the claim between the United States and the United Kingdom over the territory of Oregon. 

Trade --> Settlement --> More Trade

Potential Gains from Settling --> Settlement --> Increased Trade

## Endogeneity

Before moving forward, It is necessary to address potential concerns about endogeneity. From the foregoing discussion, it is clear that the relationship between trade and territorial claims is complex. 

The existence of a territorial claim should lead to lower levels of trade than the counterfactual case in which, all else equal, no claim exists. Nonetheless, those engaged in bilateral trade still stand to gain from an increase in trade. The greater the amount of bilateral trade that exists in the status quo, the more clout these groups should have to push for claim termination.

An alternative scenario is one in which there is a small amount of trade. Curvilinear effect?

# Domestic Politics and The Management of Territorial Claims

%%% Domestic audiences influence policy over territory

	% \footnote{Leaders who have been in office longer are more likely to make concessions or sign agreements. This suggests that leaders gain experience over time and are therefore better able to navigate the domestic pitfalls associated with settlement \citet{chiozza2003a}.} 
	% Note: Consistent with this, \citet{simmons2002} found that states with higher levels of judicial independence are more likely to comply with settlements reached as the result of international arbitration or adjudication. This suggests that domestic populations in countries with strong rule of law may be more willing to accept the decisions of international legal bodies, even if they disagree with them.
	% International institutions also play an important role in fostering multilateral talks, especially when those institutions possess the capacity to intervene in disputes \citep{shannon2009}. 
	
	% Attempts:
	% Findings related to territorial salience and conflict management generally support the notion that domestic politics plays a significant role in determining what types of policies leaders can pursue. As the salience of disputed territory increases, the value that domestic audiences attach to it increases (although this logic also applies to leaders, since they will be more concerned about external threats will to highly salient territory). As a result, settlements over highly-salient disputes should be more costly for leaders. % \footnote{However, states engage in peaceful settlement attempts more frequently over highly salient territory \citet{hensel2001, hensel2008}. This suggests that states are more invested and willing to pay the transaction costs associated with settlement attempts over valuable territory, but are less likely to actually reach an agreement over it.} %\citet{hensel2005a} finds that this is only true of intangible salience. Tangible salience decreases the probability of negotiations. 

% Compliance
% However, the factors that influence which policies domestic audiences support remain undertheorized. One exception is the steps-to-war theory, which illustrates how dyadic interactions between disputants influence the preferences of domestic audiences.
